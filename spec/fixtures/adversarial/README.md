# `adversarial/` — SEC-6 clean-rejection fixtures

Per `spec/fixtures/README.md`'s "Adversarial fixtures are a distinct shape" section: every case
in this category produces `expected/rejection.json` (validating against
`spec/fixtures/schemas/rejection.schema.json`) **instead of** any `expected/<backend>.artifact.json`
— no backend ever sees a compilable IR, because validation rejects the request before compilation
is reached.

Each fixture's `schema.json` is an ordinary, valid `GridSchema` (validates against
`spec/grid-schema.schema.json`); the adversarial part always lives in `agGridRequest.json`, never
in the schema. Most fixtures share the same base `GridSchema` (fields `id` int64, `name` string,
`amount` decimal, `quantity` int64, `price` double, `active` boolean, `createdDate` date,
`createdAt` datetime, `stableKey: "id"`, `mode: "strict"`) so the only thing that varies between
cases is the request shape.

**`source` (added #1638) is a convention here, not a derivation.** Every other category's `source`
was read back out of that fixture's own expected artifact's `FROM` clause — the authoritative
per-fixture answer. These 23 fixtures have no artifact to read (that is the point of the category),
so all 23 carry `source: "items"`, chosen to match their shared generic goods-shaped field set
(`name`/`price`/`quantity`/`amount`/`active`). Nothing in this category depends on the value: no
case here ever reaches a compiler, so no `FROM` clause is ever emitted. Keep new cases on the same
value unless one is deliberately testing something about `source` itself.

`rejectedAt` values follow the pinned validation order from
`docs/architecture/c4-components-core-ir.md`: **allowlist → resourceLimits → typeCoercion →
requestParsing**. Note `requestParsing` sits conceptually *before* allowlist in actual execution
(a request that doesn't even parse into a candidate IR shape never reaches the allowlist check) —
it is listed last among the enum's four values only because it is the catch-all for
malformed-wire-shape cases that never reach IR validation at all (see
`rejection.schema.json`'s own description of the field).

## Scoping note (read this before adding more cases)

"Injection attempts" here means **structural** injection via the wire payload shape itself — a
filter value sent as an object/array trying to smuggle extra operators, a colId that isn't even a
well-formed identifier, a JSON key collision. It does **not** mean "a normal string filter value
containing SQL metacharacters" (e.g. `filter: "'; DROP TABLE users; --"` sent as an ordinary
string to a text `equals` condition) — that is safely handled by parameterization and is not a
rejection case; such fixtures belong to the `operators/`/`dialect-parity/` categories' normal
safe-parameterization behavior, not here.

## Breakdown by validation stage

- `allowlist`: 4 (001–003, 019)
- `resourceLimits`: 8 (004–011)
- `typeCoercion`: 4 (012–015)
- `requestParsing`: 7 (016–018, 020–023)

**Total: 23 fixtures.**

## Notes on construction

- **Depth/leaf/in-values bombs (004–009)** mostly use the `customFilters` wire extension
  (OQ-11 — see `spec/fixtures/README.md`'s customFilters wire-shape note), because AG Grid's own
  `filterModel` is structurally shallow (a flat per-column map, at most two conditions per
  column) and cannot express a genuine depth/leaf bomb on its own. The exception is 008, which
  uses AG Grid's native `set` filter (mapped straight to an `in` IR comparison) since that alone
  is sufficient to exceed the max-in-values limit.
- **004/010 vs. 005/011/009** deliberately pair a "one beyond the boundary" case with a "deep
  bomb, far beyond the boundary" case for the same limit, per the task's request to pin the
  precise off-by-one separately from the general resource-exhaustion framing SEC-6 names.
- **007** specifically proves the max-leaves budget is tree-wide, not a per-node arity bound (35
  leaves in each of two `and` branches, 70 total) — see `spec/ir.schema.json`'s `andNode`/`orNode`
  descriptions for why no `maxItems` is placed on those arrays at the schema level.
- **021** is hand-authored as literal JSON text (not emitted by a serializer that would silently
  deduplicate the repeated key) specifically so the duplicate `"filter"` key survives into the
  fixture file.
- **019** deliberately shapes its colId to *look* like a SQL-injection payload
  (`"amount'); DROP TABLE users; --"`), but no spec document defines a colId shape check distinct
  from allowlist membership — the string is simply absent from `GridSchema.fields`, so this case
  is caught at the same `allowlist` stage as 001–003, not `requestParsing`. Its adversarial value
  is exactly that: an attacker gains nothing from the shape, because the allowlist rejects it
  before the shape could ever matter.
- **023** is the first case whose `reason` was added to `rejection.schema.json`'s enum by a later
  story (`duplicate-output-name`, #1886). It is also the first whose defect is invisible to every
  engine: `018`/`020` send a shape no parser can read, while this one compiles to a statement all
  five SQL dialects, MongoDB and Elasticsearch accept — and each of them then drops one of the two
  aggregates silently. Its `schema.json` is `003`'s with one edit, `amount` gaining `aggregatable`,
  so the request's only defect is the duplicated `ColumnVO.id` and not an SC-2 capability the field
  was never granted.
