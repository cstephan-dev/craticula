/// <para><b>The rule this owns, in one sentence:</b> a <c>datetimeValue</c>'s
/// <see cref="DatetimeValue.Value"/> is an instant, its <see cref="DatetimeValue.Zone"/> is
/// <em>provenance</em> recording how a wire string was resolved into that instant, and the zone is
/// never an instruction to a backend. Two requests naming the same moment as <c>…T12:00:00+02:00</c>
/// and as <c>…T10:00:00Z</c> must therefore reach every backend as one value.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why it is here rather than in each compiler (#1645).</b> The SQL compiler needs the
/// instant so it can bind the canonical <c>…Z</c> text its artifacts pin; the EF Core execution
/// adapter needs the same instant as a real <see cref="DateTime"/> so a provider can bind it as a
/// timestamp. Those are two different <em>renderings</em> of one <em>reading</em>, and AR-4 requires
/// the reading to be identical: an adapter that parsed with <see cref="DateTimeStyles.None"/> would
/// resolve a zone-less string against the machine's local time and silently return different rows on
/// a differently-configured host than the compiler it is supposed to agree with. So the parse lives
/// once, and the formatting stays with whoever needs a particular text.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Non-throwing on purpose.</b> Each caller reports a malformed value in its own
/// vocabulary — <c>SqlCompilationException</c>, <c>EfCoreCompilationException</c> — and every one of
/// them runs <see cref="FilterNodeValidator"/> first, whose <c>datetime</c> pattern already mandates
/// a trailing <c>Z</c> or an explicit offset. A failure here is therefore a caller precondition
/// failure rather than a client error, and the caller is the layer that can say so.</para>
