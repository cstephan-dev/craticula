/// <para><b>The artifact is the oracle, never a literal repeated here.</b> Every non-Postgres arm
/// was produced by mechanical transformation — #1639's 19 pre-existing ones by applying each
/// engine's quote character to their own fixture's <c>schema.json</c> identifiers, its 30 promoted
/// ones by substituting documented per-dialect tokens into that fixture's own <b>Postgres</b> arm,
/// <c>021</c>/<c>022</c>'s six by transforming the arms of the fixture whose schema they reuse
/// verbatim (<c>014</c> and <c>020</c> respectively), and #1642's 39 Oracle arms the same way from
/// the Postgres arm again — and never by running these dialects and recording the output. That is
/// what keeps this comparison between two independently-derived answers instead of a tautology. A
/// disagreement is informative in both directions and must be investigated, never resolved by
/// editing the fixture.</para>

/// <para><b>Why the parity showcases are the real assertion.</b> <c>dialect-parity/006</c>-<c>022</c>

///
