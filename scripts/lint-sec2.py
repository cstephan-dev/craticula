"""SEC-2 lint: only a placeholder, a quoted identifier, a constant or an enum may be interpolated or concatenated into
query text (TRD SEC-2, P-3; story #1660, AC-4).

Usage: lint-sec2.py [--root <repo>] [--allowlist <file>] [--stats] [--explain] [paths...]   (stdlib, Python 3.10+)

Default scope: the query-text builders csharp/src/Craticula.{Sql,Mongo,Search,Dapper,EntityFrameworkCore}/**/*.cs.
Paths are files or folders, relative to --root. Exit codes: 0 clean; 1 at least one finding or one stale allowlist
entry, each finding printed as `file:line: SEC-2: <expression> - <why> [key: <Type.Member> | <position>]`; 2 usage or
environment error: a scope path missing or holding no .cs file, an unreadable or malformed allowlist, or a construct
the lint cannot parse (it fails closed).

WHAT COUNTS AS QUERY TEXT. Every string construction in a scoped file is presumed query text (a "sink"):
  - each hole of an interpolated string ($"", $@"", @$"", raw $\"\"\"...\"\"\" with any number of $);
  - each operand of a `+` chain with a string-typed operand, and the right side of `+=` on a string. String-typed: a
    string or char literal, an interpolated string, a call that can return a string (a string method, a primitive or
    an Escape*, any scanned method of that name declared `string`), a name declared `string` (local, parameter, field),
    a `var` local any of whose initializers is string-typed, and a `?:`, `??` or switch with a string-typed branch;
  - every argument of string.Join / string.Concat / string.Format (for Join over a collection: each element);
  - every argument of StringBuilder.Append / AppendLine / AppendFormat / Insert, and the text of
    `new StringBuilder(text)`;
  - the statement handed to a database, even when no string is built around it: the command text of
    `new CommandDefinition(...)` (Dapper) and of `new <Name>Command(text, ...)` (ADO.NET: SqlCommand, NpgsqlCommand...),
    a `CommandText` assignment or initializer, the SQL argument of EF Core's FromSqlRaw / ExecuteSqlRaw(Async) /
    SqlQueryRaw and of Dapper's Query* / Execute* methods. For the ADO.NET constructors and Dapper's methods the
    argument is skipped when its type is known not to be a string (a CommandDefinition, a CancellationToken).
Exempt: everything inside the arguments of `new <Name>Exception(...)`, or of a target-typed `new(...)` in a member whose
declared type ends in `Exception`, or of an exception type's `: base(...)`. Exception messages are not query text.

WHEN A SINK OPERAND IS SAFE. Checked by provenance, recursively, under this closed list:
  - a literal (string, char, number, bool, null, default, typeof), `nameof(...)`, `string.Empty`: the author wrote it;
  - a `const` of a scanned type (bare inside the type, or Type.Name): compile-time text;
  - an enum member (Enum.Member) or a name declared with an enum type (enums of the scanned files and of csharp/src, and
    StringComparison): it renders a compiled-in identifier; a bool-valued expression (comparison, !, is) likewise;
  - a PRIMITIVE call; its arguments are not query text:
      Bind(...) and the method group X.Bind, by name: ISqlParameterSink, the value goes to the parameter list and the
        result is the dialect's placeholder (SEC-2's own mechanism);
      QuoteIdentifier(...), by name: ISqlDialect, SQL-1, a delimited identifier with its delimiter doubled;
      ParameterPlaceholder(...), by name: ISqlDialect, the placeholder text for an ordinal;
      a pattern ESCAPER, by type and name (`Type.M(...)`, or `M(...)` inside the type): MongoRegexEscaping.Escape,
        SearchRegexEscaping.Escape, SearchWildcardEscaping.Escape and Craticula.Core's SqlPatternEscaping.Escape /
        EscapeIncludingLeftBracket (outside the scanned files). ONLY in Mongo, Search and EF Core files, where the
        result is a pattern VALUE (regex, wildcard, LIKE) embedded as a JSON value or bound by EF Core (SEC-4). In a
        SQL file an escaped value in query text is a finding: escaping a pattern does not make it SQL text, binding it
        does. Any other Escape* (Uri.EscapeDataString, Regex.Escape) is code the lint cannot see.
    The body of every scanned primitive is checked with its parameters UNTRUSTED (every splice in it, and its return
    value when it returns a string), so each primitive implementation that touches raw input is a reviewed allowlist
    entry, and a method that only borrows a primitive's name (`string Bind(string x) => x;`) is caught;
  - a composition of safe parts: an interpolated string or a `+` chain (its parts are sinks of their own), string.Join,
    Concat or Format, a StringBuilder's ToString() (its appends are sinks), a cast, arithmetic, ToString/Replace/Trim/
    Substring... on a safe receiver with safe arguments, an index or a range of a safe value, LINQ Select/Where/
    ToList... whose source and selector are safe. The branches of `?:`, `??` and a switch expression (throw arms
    ignored) and the items of a tuple or collection are positions of their own, so a finding names the branch that
    brings the value in;
  - a LOCAL whose every assigned value is safe: initializer, =, +=, ??=, Add/AddRange/Insert, indexer stores, foreach
    over a safe collection, pattern and deconstruction designations. Increments add no source. An out variable, a catch
    variable or the parameter of a lambda handed to an unknown caller has no traceable source;
  - a PARAMETER of a non-primitive in-scope method whose every in-scope call site passes a safe argument (C# binding:
    by position, by name, defaults, `params`). The finding then lands on the CALL SITE, where the value enters. Call
    sites are found as calls are resolved (below), plus every unqualified call that resolves to nothing the lint can
    place (a base type outside the scan, a `using static` import), which counts as a call site of every in-scope method
    of that name. A parameter with no in-scope call site is untrusted, and so is one whose method is handed over as a
    DELEGATE: a method group (`list.ConvertAll(Render)`, `Func<..> f = this.Render`) is a call site whose arguments
    nobody can see, reported at the method group;
  - a call to an in-scope METHOD whose every return expression is safe, for every declaration the call can reach: an
    unqualified (or this./base.) call reaches a local function, else a method of an enclosing type, of its scanned base
    types and interfaces, or of the scanned types derived from it (inheritance, overrides); `Type.M(...)` that type's
    and its bases' methods; `obj.M(...)` every in-scope method named M. Tuple components consumed by deconstruction are
    followed one by one;
  - COMPILED QUERY TEXT: `<x>.Sql` where every value x can hold, through locals, parameters (every in-scope call site)
    and `with` copies, is a call to SqlQueryBuilder.Build or SqlQueryBuilder.BuildSetValues, since that text came out
    of the linted builder (the Dapper adapter); the new `Sql` of a `with` copy is query text of its own.
Anything else is a finding: a member of a runtime object (request.Value, key.Field), a call into code the lint cannot
see, a lambda parameter. It is reported where it enters: the sink operand, or the call-site argument, assigned value or
return expression that feeds a sink.

ALLOWLIST (scripts/sec2-allowlist.txt), one entry per line, '#' comments:
  `trust path::Type.Member | position | expression | reason (requirement id)`: a reviewed trust boundary, accepted as
    it stands, nothing inside it traced further. The key survives line shifts: the file, the enclosing member, the
    POSITION and the exact expression (whitespace collapsed), as the finding's `[key: ...]` prints them. The position is
    the kind of place the expression sits in: a sink (`interpolation hole`, `concatenation operand`, `StringBuilder.
    Append argument`...), `value of local x`, `collection iterated into x`, `argument p of M`, `return value`, `operand
    of ??`, `branch of ?:`, `delegate of M`... So the same text elsewhere in the member, or reaching text another way
    (the value an escaping loop iterates, appended whole), is checked again. An entry may not trust a parameter of a
    non-primitive method as it is passed in (`p`, `p.X`, `p[i]`): that would vouch for every call site, present and
    future, so it is a finding; trust the function that validates the value (its return value) or the argument.
  `not-query-text path::Type.Member | reason`: the member's result is never query text (a bound value, a message).
    Its own string constructions, and those of its local functions, are not checked; in exchange, a call that can
    reach it is a finding wherever its result reaches query text.
A STALE entry fails the run (exit 1): one whose file was scanned but that matched nothing (silenced nothing), one whose
file does not exist, and one whose file lies outside the default scope (it can never match). A run over explicit paths
does not judge an entry for a default-scope file it did not scan (`--stats` counts them).

BLIND SPOTS (syntactic, no Roslyn): calls resolve by NAME within the reach above, so overloads, interface
implementations and virtual dispatch merge (conservative: every reachable body must be safe); base types are matched
by simple name. The result of a method inherited from a type outside the scan, or imported with `using static`, is not
seen (using it is a finding). Code outside the scanned files is not seen either: calling into it is a finding, and a
caller of a scanned public method is not checked, so ISqlDialect's `quotedColumn` contract binds a host that calls a
dialect directly. Values that travel through fields, object properties, delegate variables or reflection are
untrusted, never traced. A method group is recognized where a delegate can sit (an argument, an assigned, initialized
or returned value, a branch, an element) and only when its name is not also a field, property or record member of
csharp/src (a light scan): a method sharing such a name is not seen as handed over. A `var` local is typed from its
initializers; a call types it only when the lint resolves the call as C# does (not `obj.M(...)`). Bind,
QuoteIdentifier and ParameterPlaceholder are trusted by NAME at their call sites, so a new method so named is a review
item even when its body passes. A message built in a local and thrown later is flagged (inline it). JSON keys and paths
built WITHOUT string construction (`new JsonObject { [colId] = ... }`) are not text construction: SEC-1's field
allowlist governs them. Locals are scoped per method by name, not per block (same-named locals merge their sources).
Text written through TextWriter, Span, string.Create or FormattableString is not scanned.
